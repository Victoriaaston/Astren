            <p class="about-us-text">Welcome to our art shop, Astren, where creativity and passion come together! Astren is the creation of three lifelong friends who turned their hobby into a business. Each piece of art in our shop is 100% handmade and unique, crafted with care and attention to detail. We believe that art should be accessible to everyone, and that's why we offer a diverse range of pieces to suit every taste and budget.</p>
            <p class="about-us-text">Our love for art started as a hobby, but it quickly grew into a passion. We found joy in creating something new and beautiful every day, and we wanted to share that with others. That's why we decided to open this shop and offer our pieces to the world. For us, this is more than just a business - it's a way to express ourselves and bring joy to others through our art.</p>
            <p class="about-us-text">We are proud of what we have accomplished, and we are grateful to have the opportunity to do what we love. We hope that you will find a piece of art in our shop that speaks to you and brings a smile to your face. Thank you for supporting our journey and for being a part of our story!</p>
